# Task Execution Workflow - SEC Climate Disclosure API

## ðŸŽ¯ **Task Execution Protocol**

When executing tasks from `.kiro/specs/sec-climate-disclosure-api/tasks.md`, follow this systematic approach:

### ðŸ“‹ **Pre-Task Checklist**

1. **Read Spec Documents**:

   - `requirements.md` - Understand feature requirements
   - `design.md` - Review technical design
   - `tasks.md` - Check task details and dependencies

2. **Check Current Status**:
   - Review completed tasks
   - Identify dependencies
   - Understand current codebase state

### ðŸ”„ **Task Execution Steps**

1. **Start Task**:

   - Update task status to "in_progress"
   - Focus on ONE task at a time
   - Don't auto-proceed to next task

2. **Implementation**:

   - Follow service-layer-first approach
   - Write tests for core functionality
   - Implement business logic before API endpoints

3. **Database Changes**:

   - If models change â†’ Create migration
   - Run `alembic upgrade head`
   - Verify with tests

4. **Testing**:

   - Run relevant tests
   - Fix any failures
   - Ensure functionality works as expected

5. **Complete Task**:
   - Update task status to "completed"
   - Stop and wait for user review
   - Don't automatically continue to next task

### ðŸš¨ **Critical Rules**

- **ONE TASK AT A TIME** - Never implement multiple tasks simultaneously
- **STOP AFTER COMPLETION** - Always wait for user review before next task
- **DATABASE FIRST** - Migrate schema changes immediately
- **TEST EVERYTHING** - Verify functionality works correctly
- **SERVICE LAYER FIRST** - Implement business logic before API endpoints

### ðŸ“Š **Task Categories**

**âœ… Core Services** (6.x) - **COMPLETED**:

- âœ… **Task 6.1**: Company entity management service
- âœ… **Task 6.2**: Emissions consolidation engine (PRODUCTION READY)
  - All business logic implemented and tested
  - Database schema complete with SEC-critical fields
  - PostgreSQL compatibility verified

**ðŸ”„ Workflow & Approval** (7.x) - **NEXT PRIORITY**:

- **Task 7.1**: Multi-level approval workflow service
- **Task 7.2**: Audit lock and collaboration features
- Build on existing consolidation services
- Focus on workflow state management

**ðŸ“Š Report Generation** (8.x):

- **Task 8.1**: SEC report generator service
- **Task 8.2**: Multi-format export system
- Data transformation and formatting
- File generation and delivery

**ðŸ”— API Endpoints** (9.x):

- **Task 9.1**: Emissions calculation API endpoints
- **Task 9.2**: Validation and audit API endpoints
- **Task 9.3**: Workflow and reporting API endpoints
- Build on existing services
- Focus on request/response handling

### âœ… **Success Criteria**

- Task functionality works as specified
- All tests pass
- Database schema is up-to-date
- Code follows project patterns
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

This workflow ensures systematic, reliable task execution with proper database management and testing.
